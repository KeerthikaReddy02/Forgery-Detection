# Forgery-Detection

The desire for authenticity and to protect integrity drives the identification of forged images and signatures. Therefore, we have built an application that can detect image and signature forgery.
Image forgery refers to the alteration of a digital image (copy-move image forgery detection) to hide some important information while signature forging is the illegal act of imitating another person's name or signature on documents.
These can be effectively overcome using our project.
